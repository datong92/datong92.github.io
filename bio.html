<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>I am currently an Applied Scientist Manager and Tech Lead at Amazon Advertising, having previously worked at Uber and Meta in roles focused on Applied Science and ML Engineering. Before that, I completed by PhD at UC Berkeley, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tomlin/">Professor Claire J. Tomlin</a> in the <a href="http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Hybrid Systems Laboratory</a> and being part of the <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)</a>.</p>
<p>My work in industry broadly revolves around the application of Machine Learning, statistical methods, and economics in large-scale distributed systems across diverse sectors such as search and recommendation systems, advertising, e-commerce, and transportation. My contributions have incrementally resulted in $XXX million yearly revenue and XX million daily active users across various applications.</p>
<p>During my PhD research, I was intersted in modeling and control of Cyber-Physical Systems using Applied Machine Learning and Statistical Learning. Please take a look at my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> and <a href="publications.html">publications</a> that are at the intersection of control theory, computer science, and economics, with applications to electricity markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have a passion for fostering professional development, demonstrated through my role as a guest lecturer (adjunct professor) at the University of Washington, teaching STAT/CSE 416 - Introduction to Machine Learning. I have directly contributed to XX indivduals securing jobs in large tech companies and advancing their careers through my guidance. Additionally, I have supported another XX students in securing positions in competitive Master's and PhD programs in quantitative disciplines.</p>
